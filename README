Code Grep
=========

A tool similar to Grep and Ack that provides some useful context when
searching through source code.

This tool only considers text files and once a match is found, it will print
not only the line matching the pattern but also some lines before or after that
in order to give more information.

It expands the context based on indentation and mismatched brackets,
which can provide essential information when searching for a pattern
that appears in a block of properly formatted code.
